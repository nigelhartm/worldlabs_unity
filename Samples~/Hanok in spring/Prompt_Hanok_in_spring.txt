A shallow river with clear water flows over moss-covered boulders and grey stones in the foreground. A weathered stone arch bridge spans the river, connecting the left bank to the grounds on the right. On the right side stands a large traditional Korean building with a dark, curved tiled roof, wooden pillars, and intricate decorative painting under the eaves. Large, dark tree trunks rise from the left bank, supporting a dense canopy of white cherry blossoms that stretches over the bridge and frames the scene. In the background, hazy mountains rise behind the architecture against a bright sky.
