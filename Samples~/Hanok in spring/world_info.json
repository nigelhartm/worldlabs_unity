    "caption": "The scene is a serene and historically rich Korean temple complex, rendered in a realistic style, evoking a tranquil and picturesque springtime atmosphere. A shallow river with clear water flows over moss-covered boulders and grey stones, extending from the foreground and continuing into the unseen areas of the scene. A weathered stone arch bridge spans the river, connecting the left bank to the grounds on the right, providing passage across the flowing water. On the right side, a large traditional Korean building stands prominently, featuring a dark, curved tiled roof, sturdy wooden pillars, and intricate decorative painting under the eaves that wraps around its entire perimeter. Large, dark tree trunks rise from the left bank, supporting a dense canopy of white cherry blossoms that stretches over the bridge and frames the scene, indicating the abundance of these flowering trees throughout the complex. In the background, hazy mountains rise majestically behind the architecture, their peaks partially obscured by the mist, extending across the entire horizon under a bright sky. The grounds surrounding the buildings are meticulously maintained, featuring carefully sculpted bushes and pathways that meander through additional cherry blossom trees and other traditional landscaping elements. Other structures, similar in architectural style, are nestled among the trees, suggesting a sprawling temple complex that continues far beyond the immediate view. ",
